Proprietary software is commercially produced by an organisation for  profit and users must pay for their use and sign or agree to licenses that give them limited rights but have lots of restrictions that limit how they can use the software.

Open source software is completely free to use and is constantly upgraded by users who under the licence are obliged to charge no fee if they pass it on to other users e.g. Open Office, Linux, Android.
The four key freedoms of the open source movement are:
1. The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.
2. The freedom to study how the program works and change it.
3. The freedom to redistribute copies.
4. The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others
