A stakeholder is a person or group of people who own or have an interest in something such as a business or enterprise. They all deserve to benefit from the venture.

For example the stakeholders in a school are the students, parents, employees, the local authority and the community. They all have an interest in the running and success of the school.

We are all stakeholders in the society in which we live and have rights and responsibilities. 
For example we should all dispose of old equipment in the correct way and not harm the environment.
The whole population of the world are stakeholders in computer science and benefits that it brings.
Unfortunately not everyone benefits equally and there is a digital divide with some people receiving very few or none of the benefits.
This may be due to lack of education, money or the infrastructure of the countries in which they live. Even in this country there is a digital divide between the people who have fast broadband access to the internet and those who do not.

It is an ethical responsibility of all societies to reduce and eliminate this digital divide.
